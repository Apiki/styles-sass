# Starter for SASS

`styles-sass` is a SASS-powered structure and functions, ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications.

## Instalation

In your project folder run the following commands:

* `git clone git@github.com:Apiki/styles-sass.git styles`
* `rm -rf styles/test styles/.git`

*Optional*

You can use our `.editorconfig` and `.gitignore` files, just move to your `project/` folder.

Or just delete from this command:
